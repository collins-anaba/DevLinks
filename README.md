This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Dev Links is a linkedin clone which is designed specifically for software engineers. This was a group project between myself and three others; Bryan, Chris, and Rachel.

Evulukwu:
Dev Links features a Job wizard so employers can post jobs for potential candidates. I used Redux to pass employer inputs from the job wizard to the job listings page.


Bryan: 
Dev Links used firebase as database. This housed all the information regarding logger information, joblistings, potential client profiles etc. Firebase also connected the backend to the front end

Rachel:
Dev Links incorporated encryption for passwords.  Brcypt was implemented for that. Rachel also set up the styling of the Dev Links using Material-UI and Reactstrap.

Chris:
Dev Links had client profiles which Chris utilized Redux to pass information from the client profile to the job listing. Another feature for Dev Links is the chat room where potential clients and employers can communicate and set up meet ups with one another. This was accomplished with socket.io.
